# About The Project
**Network Automation** has been the name of the game, in past couple of decades. With techologies like **Software Defined Networking(SDN)** and **Intent Based Networking(IBN)** being used widespreadly in the industry today, this project is a small effort towards understandig Network Programmability and Automation using Python. All the modules used in this project have been explained below;
